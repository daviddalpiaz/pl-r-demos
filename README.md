## Demo Questions for the R Autograder for PrairieLearn

### R Demos

This repository is derived from the [pl-template](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/pl-template) repo,
and still contains its _Gallery_ of (Python-based) questions.  But it also adds a number of
_reference questions_ for the [R Autograder](https://github.com/stat447/rocker-pl) used by [STAT 430
'DSPM'](https://stat430.com) (2018-2020) and now by [STAT 447](https://stat447.com) as well as other
courses.

The main reason for this repository is to highlight the mechanics of the autograder and it simple
test scripts to assess questions.  It aims to demonstrate a few key features---but it not meant to
be a library of exam questions (which we would not want to be in a globally readable repository
anyway as our students are a little too inquisitive for that...)

The remainder of the PL docs follow.  We will adjust this as needed going forward.
